 * @mainpage    XSFoundation - XEOS C Foundation Library
 * @section     about_xeos  About XEOS
 *              XEOS is an experimental 32 bits Operating System for x86
 *              platforms, written in Assembly and C, including a C89 Standard
 *              Library (with some C99 parts).
 * @section     about_xs    About XSFoundation
 *              The XEOS C Foundation library provides the base for
 *              object-oriented C style coding, reference counting memory
 *              management with auto-release capabilities, reflection, runtime
 *              environment, polymorphism, exceptions, and basic objects.
 *              It's purpose is to be integrated in the XEOS Operating System,
 *              once its C standard library will be c
 omplete.
 *              For now, it's just a standalone project, that should compile on
 *              every OS with a decent C compiler.
 * @section     os          Supported OS
 *              XSFoundation can be used on POSIX compliant systems
 *              (Mac OS X, Unix, Linux) as well as on Windows.
 * @section     source      Source access
