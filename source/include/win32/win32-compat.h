 * @brief       Do not warn about stupid Microsoft "security enhancements"
 * @details     Microsoft provides "security" enhanced version of standard
 *              C library functions, like sprintf, (with xxx_s counterparts),
 *              intended to prevent buffer overflows. Defining this macro turns
 *              off those annoying warnings in VisualStudio.
 *              Those "enhancements" won't prevent a buffer overflow anyway.
 *              If you don't know what you are doing, then keep on coding in
 *              C# or Java.
