        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            The XEOS C Foundation library provides the base for object-oriented C style coding, reference counting memory management with auto-release capabilities, reflection, runtime environment, polymorphism, and basic objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its purpose is to be integrated in the <a href="http://www.xs-labs.com/en/projects/xeos/" title="XEOS">XEOS Operating System</a>, once its C standard library will be complete.<br />
            For now, it's just a standalone project, that should compile on every OS with a decent C compiler.
        </p>
        <h4>Supported OS</h4>
        <p>
            XSFoundation can be used on POSIX compliant systems (Mac OS X, Unix, Linux) as well as on Windows.
